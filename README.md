📌 Overview

This project is a browser-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects a move each round. The game displays the result instantly and keeps track of the score.

🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to practice JavaScript fundamentals by building an interactive game. It focuses on understanding game logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence using browser storage.

🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML – Structure of the game interface
* CSS – Styling and layout
* JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity
