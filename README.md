## 📌 Overview

The **Rock Paper Scissors Game** is a browser-based interactive game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The user plays against the computer, which generates a random move each round. The game instantly displays the result and maintains a persistent score using browser storage.

This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts through a simple but complete game application.
